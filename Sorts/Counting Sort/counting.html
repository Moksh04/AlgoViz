        <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
        Counting sort is an integer sorting algorithm used in computer science to collect objects according to keys that
        are small positive integers.
        <br><br>
        It works by determining the positions of each key value in the output sequence by counting the number of objects
        with distinct key values and applying prefix sum to those counts.
        <br><br>
        Because its running duration is proportional to the number of items and the difference between the maximum and
        minimum key values, it is only suited for direct usage when the number of items is not much more than the
        variation in keys.
        <br><br>
        It's frequently used as a subroutine in radix sort, a more efficient sorting method for larger keys.

Counting_Sort( array, ele ) // ele is number of elements in the array

max = discover the array's biggest element
            
Create a count array of maximum + 1 size and fill it with all 0s.
            
for i = 0 to ele
    discover the total number of occurrences of each element and save the count in the count array at the index.
            
for i = 0 to max
    Add the current(i) and previous(i-1) counts to get the cumulative sum, which you may save in the count array.
            
For j = ele down to 1
    Decrement the count of each element copied by one before copying it back into the input array.
